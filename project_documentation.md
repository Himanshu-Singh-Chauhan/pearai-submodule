## Key Components

### Core

The core component is the heart of our project. It includes:
- Configuration handling (`core/config/`): Manages project-wide settings and configurations.
- Core functionality implementation: Includes the main logic for code analysis, suggestion generation, and other key features.
- Utility functions (`core/util/`): Provides helper functions and shared utilities used across the project.
- Test suite for core components (`core/test/`): Ensures the reliability and correctness of core functionalities.
- Context providers: Implements various context providers for enhanced code understanding.
- LLM integration: Incorporates Large Language Model capabilities for advanced code analysis and suggestions.

### GUI

The GUI component provides a graphical interface for users to interact with the tool. It's implemented in the `gui/src/` directory and includes:
- User interface components: React-based UI elements for a smooth user experience.
- State management: Handles application state and user interactions.
- API integration with the core: Communicates with the core component to process user requests and display results.
- Chat interface: Implements a chat-like interface for user interactions with the tool.
- Context menu: Provides quick access to various features and options.

### VSCode Extension

The VSCode extension (`extensions/vscode/`) integrates our tool directly into Visual Studio Code. It includes:
- Extension activation and deactivation logic: Manages the lifecycle of the extension within VSCode.
- Command implementations for VSCode: Defines custom commands that users can invoke within VSCode.
- Integration with VSCode's API: Utilizes VSCode's extension API to seamlessly integrate with the editor.
- Custom views or panels within VSCode: Implements dedicated views for our tool's output and interactions.
- File system watchers: Monitors file changes to provide real-time suggestions and analysis.
- Syntax highlighting and code completion: Enhances the coding experience with custom language support.

The VSCode extension has two primary responsibilities:
1. Implement the IDE side of the PearAI IDE protocol, allowing a PearAI server to interact natively in an IDE. This is implemented in `src/continueIdeClient.ts`.
2. Open the PearAI React app in a side panel. The React app's source code lives in the `gui` directory. The panel is opened by the `continue.openContinueGUI` command, as defined in `src/commands.ts`.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/trypear/pearai-submodule.git
cd pearai-submodule

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the GUI
npm run start-gui

# For VSCode extension development
code .
# Then press F5 to start debugging the extension
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the `config.example.json` file to `config.json` in the root directory.
2. Edit `config.json` to set up your preferred LLM provider and other settings.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Debugging

For detailed logs and debugging information, set the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=pearai:* npm run start-gui
```

### VSCode Extension Development

To run and debug the VSCode extension:

1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. Run the `Extension (VSCode)` launch configuration in VS Code.

Note: We require vscode engine `^1.67.0` and use `@types/vscode` version `1.67.0` because this is the earliest version that doesn't break any of the APIs we are using. If you go back to `1.66.0`, it will break `vscode.window.tabGroups`.

#### Packaging and Publishing the VSCode Extension

To package the VSCode extension for distribution:

1. Ensure you have the `vsce` tool installed: `npm install -g vsce`
2. Run `vsce package` in the `extensions/vscode` directory
3. This will generate a `.vsix` file which can be installed in VSCode

To publish the extension to the VSCode Marketplace:

1. Ensure you have a Microsoft account and have been added as a publisher
2. Run `vsce publish` in the `extensions/vscode` directory

For more detailed instructions on packaging and publishing, refer to the official VSCode documentation.

### Configuring the VSCode Extension Settings

The VSCode extension provides several settings that can be configured to customize its behavior. To access the extension settings:

1. Open the VSCode settings by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Preferences > Settings` on macOS).
2. In the search bar, type "PearAI" to filter the settings.
3. You will see a list of available settings for the PearAI VSCode extension, such as:
   - `pearai.apiKey`: Your PearAI API key, required for the extension to function.
   - `pearai.serverUrl`: The URL of the PearAI server to connect to.
   - `pearai.enableLogging`: Toggle logging for the extension.
4. Update the settings as needed and save the changes. The extension will automatically pick up the new settings.

For more detailed information on the available settings and their descriptions, please refer to the `extensions/vscode/package.json` file, which contains the extension's contribution points, including the settings.

#### Measuring the Effectiveness of Code Reviews

To ensure your code review process is truly beneficial, consider implementing these metrics:

1. **Defect Detection Rate**: Track the number of bugs found during reviews versus those found later in testing or production.
2. **Review Velocity**: Monitor how quickly reviews are completed to ensure they're not becoming a bottleneck.
3. **Code Quality Metrics**: Use tools to measure improvements in code quality (e.g., complexity, maintainability) over time.
4. **Knowledge Sharing Index**: Survey team members to gauge how much they're learning from the review process.
5. **Feedback Implementation Rate**: Track how often review feedback is successfully implemented.
6. **Time to Resolution**: Measure the average time it takes to resolve issues identified in code reviews.
7. **Review Coverage**: Track the percentage of code changes that undergo review before being merged.
8. **Reviewer Diversity**: Monitor the distribution of reviews across team members to ensure diverse perspectives.
9. **Code Churn**: Measure the amount of code that is rewritten or deleted shortly after being introduced, which can indicate ineffective reviews.
10. **Rework Rate**: Track how often code changes are sent back for revision after review, indicating the thoroughness of initial reviews.
11. **Technical Debt Reduction**: Measure the reduction in technical debt as a result of code reviews.
12. **Security Vulnerability Detection**: Track the number of security vulnerabilities identified during code reviews.
13. **Code Review Efficiency**: Calculate the ratio of issues found to time spent on reviews.
14. **Peer Review Participation**: Monitor the participation rate of team members in the review process.
15. **Code Review Cycle Time**: Measure the time from when a review is requested to when it's completed.

Regularly analyzing these metrics can help you refine and improve your code review process, leading to higher quality code and a more skilled, collaborative development team. Consider using automated tools to collect and visualize these metrics, making it easier to identify trends and areas for improvement in your code review process.

To implement these metrics effectively, consider integrating your version control system with a code review tool that can automatically track and report on these metrics. This will provide valuable insights into your team's performance and the overall effectiveness of your code review process.

Remember that while metrics are valuable, they should be used to guide improvements rather than as strict performance indicators. The ultimate goal is to foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement through the code review process.

#### Interpreting Code Review Metrics

When analyzing these metrics, consider the following:

1. **Trends over time**: Look for improvements or declines in metrics over time rather than focusing on absolute values.
2. **Contextual factors**: Consider project complexity, team experience, and other factors that might influence metrics.
3. **Balanced approach**: Don't optimize for a single metric at the expense of others. Aim for a balanced improvement across all areas.
4. **Team feedback**: Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative feedback from team members to get a complete picture.
5. **Continuous adjustment**: Regularly review and adjust your metrics and goals based on the evolving needs of your team and projects.
6. **Correlation analysis**: Look for relationships between different metrics to gain deeper insights into your review process.
